Let’s say you work at Costco. Costco has a database with two tables. The first is users composed of user information, including their registration date, and the second is purchases that has the entire item purchase history (if any) for those users.

Write a query to get the total amount spent on each item in the ‘purchases’ table by users that registered in 2022.

Example:

Input:

users table

Column	Type
user_id	INTEGER
user_name	VARCHAR
registration_date	DATETIME
purchases table

Column	Type
order_id	INTEGER
user_id	INTEGER
item	VARCHAR
price	FLOAT
purchase_date	DATETIME
Output:

Column	Type
item	VARCHAR
total_amount_spent	FLOAT


# SOLUTION

SELECT item, SUM(price) AS total_amount_spent
FROM purchases pc  JOIN users users
ON pc.user_id = users.user_id
WHERE YEAR(registration_date) = "2022"
GROUP BY item
